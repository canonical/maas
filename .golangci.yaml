  # If set we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.

  # Format: `colored-line-number`, `line-number`, `json`, `colored-tab`, `tab`, `checkstyle`, `code-climate`, `junit-xml`, `github-actions`, `teamcity`

  # For the CLI flag (`--out-format`), multiple formats can be specified by separating them by comma.
