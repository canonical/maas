## Pro tips

- **Brevity is key**: Keep sentences short and to the point. Just say it.
- **Active voice**: Talk to the user. Use active rather than passive voice for clarity.
- **Clear comparisons**: Complexity loses readers. Use simple, relatable comparisons to explain concepts. You're teaching, not boasting.
- **Conversational Rhythm**: Mix short sentences with longer explanatory ones.
