You interact with the MAAS community primarily through [our Discourse forum](https://discourse.maas.io/). This page helps you make the most of that space.

## Discourse categories

The forum is organised into several public categories:

- **[discourse](https://discourse.maas.io/c/discourse/3)**: A default, largely unmonitored category. Response times here are inconsistent.
  
- **[docs](https://discourse.maas.io/c/docs/5)**: Home to our documentation. Edit or comment on docs here.

- **[news](https://discourse.maas.io/c/news/7)**: Primarily for release announcements and deprecations.

- **[users](https://discourse.maas.io/c/users/8)**: The hub of activity, monitored by the weekly on-duty MAAS developer. We aim to keep unanswered posts below 5% of the total.

- **[integration](https://discourse.maas.io/c/integration/11)**: Currently inactive; use "Users" instead.

- **[development](https://discourse.maas.io/c/devel/13)**: For road-map and architecture talks, and where Show and Tell articles are published.

- **[tutorials](https://discourse.maas.io/c/tutorials/16)**: Find various MAAS tutorials to help you get up to speed.

- **[deprecations](https://discourse.maas.io/c/deprecations/17)**: Strictly for deprecated feature discussions.

- **[performance](https://discourse.maas.io/c/maas-performance/26)**: Focused on MAAS performance topics.
