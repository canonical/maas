  # or directories other than what the oops machinery creates there.
  #
  # directory:
  directory: "logs/oops"
  # reporter:

## Boot configuration.
boot:
  ## CPU architectures for which boot images should be downloaded from the
  ## server, e.g. ['i386/generic', 'amd64/generic'].  MAAS needs these images
  ## in order to boot nodes up.
  ##
  ## Leave this option out to download images for all architectures.
  #
  # architectures:

  ## Settings for ephemeral boot images.  These images are used when
  ## commissioning nodes, and during fast-path installation.
  #
  ephemeral:

    ## Directory where ephemeral boot images and related state should be
    ## stored.
    #
    #   images_directory: /var/lib/maas/ephemeral
    images_directory: /var/lib/maas/ephemeral

    ## Releases for which ephemeral images should be downloaded.
    ## These images are quite large (about a quarter GB each), so you may want
    ## to restrict these separately even if you do want the regular install
    ## images for all releases.  Leave this out to download all currently
    ## supported releases.
